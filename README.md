# A latent space model of general hypergraph

R implementation of examples in chapter $4$

### Folders
- `code` R codes files
- `data` Starwar hypergraph dataset
- `demo` R implementation of examples in chapter $4$



### Requirements

- `requirments.R` contains R packages requried in experiments. To install them,
```R
    Rscript requirment.R
```



### Usages

```shell
    cd demo
```
To run demo, one need jupyter notebook and R kenerl installed.

- Simulation study on dependence between shape parameter and cluster coefficient, in `demo/demo_cluster_coef.ipynb`

- Demo on single run of mcem, `demo/demo_mcem_general_hg.ipynb`.

- Analytics on Star War hypergraphs, `demo/demo_analysis_starwar.ipynb`.
